## Choosing the right shell - Fish shell

# Idea

I need a good shell out of the box, `oh-my-xxx` are still too much work. 

Use [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

## Reasons

People spend a lot of time-wasting time on things that don't matter (much). I should do something productive or [shag](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shag). Wasting my time polishing my shell setup is a bit too much.

Of course, there is [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) if needed.

## My Setup

I use [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) as the desktop shell on my Linux and macOS computers, there is a Windows version as well... but I don't use it. 

Scripting is the only problem I've had with [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) as I like the idea to have universal and portable scripting, and I'll not install Fish on any server/headless server. 

For this reason, for scripting, I'll use `bash` and for more involved scripts `python3` or [jbang](https://www.jbang.dev/) depending on the situation. 

## To my readers

Please enjoy some information about [Fish](https://fishshell.com/).
